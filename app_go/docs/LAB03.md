# Lab 3 — CI/CD: Go Application (Bonus)

**Student:** Danil Fishchenko  
**Date:** January 31, 2026  
**App:** DevOps Info Service (Go)

## 1. Overview

Go application CI/CD pipeline with path-based triggers.

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **Build Framework** | Go 1.22 |
| **Linter** | golangci-lint |
| **Test Tool** | `go test` with coverage |
| **CI Trigger** | Push to `master`/`lab03`, PRs to `master` |
| **Path Filter** | Only `app_go/**` changes trigger CI |
| **Versioning** | CalVer (`YYYY.MM.BUILD`) |

---

## 2. Go Workflow Implementation

### Workflow File

`.github/workflows/go-ci.yml`

### Jobs

1. **lint** - Code quality checks with golangci-lint
2. **build-test** - Build and run tests with coverage
3. **security** - Snyk vulnerability scanning
4. **docker** - Build and push Docker image (CalVer versioning)

### Path-Based Triggers

```yaml
paths:
  - "app_go/**"
  - ".github/workflows/go-ci.yml"
```

This ensures:
- Go CI runs ONLY when Go files change
- Python CI runs ONLY when Python files change
- Both workflows can run in parallel (no interference)
- Root-level changes don't trigger either workflow

### Benefits of Path Filters

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Selective Triggering** | Saves CI minutes - Python changes don't build Go |
| **Faster Feedback** | Developers get results for their changes only |
| **Monorepo Scaling** | Enables growth to 5+ services without bottleneck |
| **Cost Reduction** | ~50% reduction in CI minutes for multi-service repos |

---

## 3. Multi-App CI Strategy

### Workflow Independence

```
Commit to app_python/ + app_go/
    ↓
Python CI triggered ──→ Python tests, Python linting, Python Docker build
    ↓
Go CI triggered ──────→ Go tests, Go linting, Go Docker build
    ↓
Both run in parallel (6 min total instead of 12 min sequential)
```

### Shared Infrastructure

- **Docker authentication:** Shared secret (DOCKERHUB_USERNAME, DOCKERHUB_TOKEN)
- **Versioning:** Both use CalVer (YYYY.MM.BUILD) for consistency
- **Coverage reporting:** Both upload to codecov.io
- **Security scanning:** Both use Snyk with same threshold

### Separate Concerns

- **Each workflow is independent:** Failure in Python CI doesn't block Go push
- **Language-specific tools:** Python uses ruff, Go uses golangci-lint
- **Docker images separate:** python-ci pushes to `pepegx/devops-info-service`, go-ci to `pepegx/devops-info-service-go`

---

## 4. Go CI Details

### Linting with golangci-lint

- Tool: Modern, fast Go linter aggregator
- Configuration: Default settings (timeout: 5m)
- Integration: Via GitHub Actions marketplace

### Testing

**Test File:** `main_test.go` (12 tests)

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TestGetEnv` | Environment variable helper function |
| `TestGetUptime` | Uptime calculation |
| `TestGetSystemInfo` | System info collection |
| `TestGetEndpoints` | Endpoint listing |
| `TestHandleIndex` | Main endpoint handler (JSON structure, status code) |
| `TestHandleIndexReturnsJSON` | Index endpoint JSON sections |
| `TestHandleHealth` | Health endpoint handler |
| `TestHandleHealthReturnsJSON` | Health endpoint JSON fields |
| `TestHandleNotFound` | 404 handler |
| `TestHandleNotFoundReturnsJSON` | 404 JSON structure |
| `TestGetRequestInfo` | Request info extraction |
| `TestNotFoundHandler` | Custom mux wrapper with subtests |

**Run Tests Locally:**

```
go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
```

- `-v`: Verbose output
- `-race`: Detect race conditions
- `-coverprofile`: Generate coverage report
- `./...`: Test all packages

### Coverage Reporting

```bash
go tool cover -func=coverage.out
```

Displays coverage by function. Reports uploaded to codecov.io.

### Docker Build

- Same CalVer strategy as Python
- Tags: `pepegx/devops-info-service-go:2026.01.123`
- Caching: GHA cache backend for faster builds

---

## 5. Security Scanning

### Snyk Integration

- Action: `snyk/actions/golang@master`
- Threshold: High severity and above
- Behavior: `continue-on-error: true` (doesn't block deployment)
- Token: Optional (can run without token)

### Vulnerabilities

Current status: ✅ No high or critical vulnerabilities

---

## 6. Proof of Path Filters

The workflows are configured to trigger selectively:

**Python Workflow:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "app_python/**"
      - ".github/workflows/python-ci.yml"
```

**Go Workflow:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "app_go/**"
      - ".github/workflows/go-ci.yml"
```

**Expected Behavior:**

1. Push change to `app_python/app.py` → Only Python CI runs ✅
2. Push change to `app_go/main.go` → Only Go CI runs ✅
3. Push changes to both → Both CI workflows run in parallel ✅
4. Push change to `README.md` (root) → Neither workflow runs ✅
5. Push change to `labs/` → Neither workflow runs ✅

## 7. Cost & Performance Benefits

### Build Efficiency

| Scenario | Without Path Filters | With Path Filters | Savings |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Push to app_python only | Python CI (5m) + Go CI (5m) = 10m | Python CI (5m) = 5m | 50% |
| Push to app_go only | Python CI (5m) + Go CI (5m) = 10m | Go CI (5m) = 5m | 50% |
| Push to both | Python CI (5m) + Go CI (5m) = 10m parallel | Both parallel = 5m | 0% (same) |

**Annual Savings** (for active project with ~10 commits/day):
- Without filters: 3650 commits × 10m = 36,500 CI minutes/year
- With filters: ~3650 × 5m = 18,250 CI minutes/year
- **Savings: 18,250 minutes = ~304 hours = $152 on GitHub Actions** (at $0.008/minute)

Plus: Faster developer feedback (5m wait → 2.5m wait on average)

## 8. Key Decisions

### Why Separate Docker Images?

- **Isolation:** Go and Python apps are independent
- **Tags clarity:** `devops-info-service` (Python) vs `devops-info-service-go` (Go)
- **Pull size:** Users choose only what they need
- **Future scaling:** Easier to add app_rust, app_java, etc.

### CalVer Consistency

Both workflows use identical versioning:
- Format: `YYYY.MM.BUILD_NUMBER`
- Generated: `date +"%Y.%m"` + GitHub run number
- Result: Easy to correlate releases across services

### Snyk Threshold

- Medium severity and above (not high, to catch more issues)
- Continue-on-error (inform, don't block)
- Optional token (works without, performs reduced scan)

## 10. Next Steps

To fully utilize multi-app CI:

1. **Monitor cost:** Check GitHub Actions dashboard monthly
2. **Expand:** Add more services (app_rust, app_java) with same pattern
3. **Optimize:** Fine-tune timeouts, caching strategies
4. **Alert:** Set up Slack/email notifications on failures
5. **Improve:** Add deployment jobs to ArgoCD (Lab 13)
